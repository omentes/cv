            <p>
                I have been working in the web industry for the past experience_years years.
                I'm writing a code according to SOLID, KISS, YAGNI, DRY.
                I'm publishing all my pet projects on Github as I adore open source.
                I'm a back-end developer, and I fancy creating telegram bots.
                During the russian invasion of Ukraine, I started to be a volunteer.
                From 01/2023 - I was COO of "Let's See The Victory."
                Charity Foundation works on a project with neuroprosthesis for blind people.
                This CV was <a href="https://github.com/setnemo/cv">created</a> on PHP with GitHub Actions, as I can't live without automation.

                <h4>Senior PHP Developer at NDA (~300 mln users) <span>Remote, Ukraine - 04/2022 - Present</span></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Anti-Fraud department tasks</li>
                    <li>With my team, I created a system of automatic selection of the optimal task, which is ideal for execution at a specific moment for a specific co-worker. For the calculation, we used more than 5 levers converted into percentiles to obtain the sum of importance for each type of task. The employee had to choose one of 24 types of tasks, and this system allowed to choose the most optimal type of task, taking into account such options as how long the employee has been doing the same, how long this task has been waiting for completion, what is the average performance of the employee for this type of tasks, etc.</li>

                <p>The mission of our non-profit is to help people who have lost their sight regain sight, especially those who have lost sight due to the war. Because eye transplantation is not possible, people who have lost their sight and wish to regain vision are not most doctors’ first priority. The founders of this non-profit comprise of people who already know about this type of suffering, and want to change this. Vladyslav Yeschenko lost his eyes in the war, and Artem Pakhomov was looking for technologies that exist for lost eyesight, or are currently being researched abroad. Our research has found a procedure that can make a blind person partially sighted, but it is still being tested. The fund plans to cooperate with researchers of this technology or otherwise create conditions so that Ukrainians who have lost their sight have access to this technology. Adapting this technology is now the number one mission of the non-profit, and our foundation is in talks with researchers to expand its potential.</p>
